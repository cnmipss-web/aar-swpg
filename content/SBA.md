## Standards-Based Assesments

SBA, a criterion-referenced test, developed locally to measure students’ knowledge of the standards and benchmarks in Chamorro Carolinian Language Heritage Studies and NMI History. Students performance are compared against the body of knowledge they’re supposed to learn. SBA is reported in four performance levels: Beginning, Developing, Proficient, and Advanced.
